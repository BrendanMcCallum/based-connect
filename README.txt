based-connect
=============

If you own Bose headphones, you'll know that Bose Connect is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app in order to give the
headphones Linux support.

I have only tested these on my own Bose QuietComfort 35's with firmware 1.3.2.
I cannot ensure that this program works on any other devies.
