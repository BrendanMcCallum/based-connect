based-connect
=============

If you own Bose headphones, you'll know that Bose Connect is not available on
Linux. This program attempts to reverse engineer that app in order to give the
headphones Linux support.

Disclaimer
----------

I have only tested these on my own Bose QuietComfort 35's with firmware 1.3.2.
I cannot ensure that this program works on any other devies.

Todo
----

* Implement "getters" for current headphone state
	* Battery
	* Current status of all setters currently implemented
	* Serial number
	* Firmware version
	* Date of manufacturing
* Implement device control
* Get/set volume
* Any TODOs in the code
